# IOStreams
      
**IOstreams** can be used for a wide variety of data manipulations thanks to the following features:

- A 'stream' is internally nothing but a series of characters. 
- Streams work with built-in data types, and you can make user-defined types work with streams by overloading the insertion operator (<<) to put objects into streams, and the extraction operator (>>) to read objects from streams.
- The stream library's unified approach makes it very friendly to use. Using a consistent interface for outputting to the screen and sending files over a network makes life easier.

#Streams
      
Streams are serial interfaces to storage, buffers files, or any other storage medium. The difference between storage media is intentionally hidden by the interface; you may not even know what kind of storage you're working with but the interface is exactly the same.

# Error handling with IO streams

<br>
Handling errors gracefully is important for building a robust system. The 'errors' or 'signals' (e.g., reaching the end of the file) in this case generally occur when a stream encounters something it didn't expect.

<br><br><br>      
```cpp
ifstream file( "test.txt" );
* if ( ! file )
{
        cout << "An error occurred opening the file" << endl;
}
```

# File I/O

File I/O is done by manually declaring objects of the ifstream, ofstream or fstream classes (from the <fstream> header) and then associating a file with the stream by using the stream's open method with the file's name as an argument.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
*        ofstream ofs("a.txt",ios::app);
        if(ofs.good())
        {
                ofs<<"Hello a.txt, I'm appending this on you.";
        }
        return 0;
}
```

#StringStreams
A  **stringstream** associates a string object with a stream allowing you to read from the string as if it were a stream (like cin). To use stringstream, we need to include _**sstream**_ header file. The stringstream class is extremely useful in parsing input. 
<br><br>
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
        stringstream my_stream(ios::in|ios::out);
        std::string dat("Hey, I have a double : 74.79 .");
 
        my_stream.str(dat);
        my_stream.seekg(-7,ios::end);
 
       
 
```      
---

#Basic methods

1.  **clear()-** To clear the stream.
2.  **str()-** To get and set string object whose content is present in the stream. 
3.  **operator <<-** Add a string to the stringstream object. 
4.  **operator >>-** Read something from the stringstream object.
